I have faced the same issue!
I tried everything from YT comments to ChatGPT finally the solution by @kwm0304 and @gkpk30 worked

To summarise

Go to your backend folder's terminal and do
npm install cors

Middleware code!
//middleware
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

app.use((req, res, next) => {
console.log(req.path, req.method);
next();
});

app.use('/api/workouts', workoutRoutes);

3: finally in your vite.config.js

export default defineConfig({
plugins: [react()],
server: {
proxy: {
'/api': {
target: 'http://localhost:4000',
changeOrigin: true,
secure: false,
},
},
},
});
